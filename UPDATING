This file describes special operations that must be performed for an
upgrade between GNUnet versions.  You can obtain version of GNUnet
that you have installed by running

$ gnunetd --version

If no migration procedure is listed for your version, a
data-preserving migration may not be possible.  For SVN versions,
you're on your own.


0.7.0pre6, 0.7.0, 0.7.0{a,b,c} to 0.7.0d
========================================

Run

$ gnunet-update

(as the same user that also runs gnunetd).


0.7.0pre4 and 0.7.0pre5 to 0.7.0pre6
====================================

Run

$ rm -f /var/lib/GNUnet/content/gnunet.dat ~/.gnunet/content/gnunet.dat
$ gnunet-update

(as the same user that also runs gnunetd).


0.7.0pre1 and 0.7.0pre2 to 0.7.0pre3
====================================

Interesting.  You got those to RUN!?


before 0.7.0pre1 to 0.7.0pre1
=============================

Migration is NOT possible, we're breaking compatibility big time.
Note that 0.7.0pre1 is a pre-release for 0.7.0, so hands-off if you do
not want to deal with a few bugs and the lack of documentation and
user interfaces.  Generally, you want to do

$ rm -rf .gnunet

before starting 0.7.0pre1.  Also, while it maybe possible that 
migration from 0.7.0pre1 to 0.7.0 will be painless, there's no
guarantee for that.

Note that many things have changed in this version, so please read
the documentation very carefully, but also keep in mind that not
all of the documentation is up-to-date with the code at this point.
