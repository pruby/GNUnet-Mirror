.SH NAME
gnunet\-insert \- a command line interface for inserting new content into GNUnet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-insert
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] FILENAME
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
In order to share files with other GNUnet users, the files must first
be made available to GNUnet.  GNUnet does not automatically share all
files from a certain directory.  In fact, even files that are
downloaded are not automatically shared.
.PP
In order to start sharing files, the files must be added either using
gnunet\-insert or gnunet\-gtk.  The command line tool gnunet\-insert
is more useful if many files are supposed to be added.  gnunet\-insert
can automatically insert batches of files, recursively insert
directories, create directories that can be browsed within GNUnet and
publish file lists in a namespace.  When run on a directory,
gnunet\-insert will always recursively publish all of the files in the
directory.
.PP
gnunet\-insert can automatically extract keywords from the files that
are shared.  Users that want to download files from GNUnet use
keywords to search for the appropriate content.  You can disable
keyword extraction with the \-D option.  You can manually add keywords
using the \-k and \-K options.
.PP
In addition to searching for files by keyword, GNUnet allows
organizing files into directories.  With directories, the user only
needs to find the directory in order to be able to download any of the
files listed in the directory.  Directories can contain pointers to
other directories.
.PP
With gnunet\-insert, it is easy to create new directories
simultaneously when adding the files.  Simply pass the name of
a directory instead of a file.
.PP
Since keywords can be spammed (any user can add any content under any
keyword), GNUnet supports namespaces.  A namespace is a subset of the
searchspace into which only the holder of a certain pseudonym can add
content.  Any GNUnet user can create any number of pseudonyms using
\fBgnunet\-pseudonym\-create\fR. Pseudonyms are stored in the users
GNUnet directory and can be additionally protected with a password.
While pseudonyms are locally identified with an arbitrary string that
the user selects when the pseudonym is created, the namespace is
globally known only under the hash of the public key of the pseudonym.
Since only the owner of the pseudonym can add content to the
namespace, it is impossible for other users to pollute the namespace.
gnunet\-insert automatically inserts the top\-directory (or the only
file if only one file is specified) into the namespace if a pseudonym
is specified.  If no specific namespace\-identifier is specified
(option \-t), gnunet\-insert selects a random identifier.
.PP
It is possible to update content in GNUnet if that content was placed
and obtained from a particular namespace.  Updates are only possible
for content in namespaces since this is the only way to assure that a
malicious party can not supply counterfeited updates.  GNUnet supports
two types of updateable content, sporadically updated content and
periodically updated content. If content is periodically updated
(every day, every week, etc.), the period must be passed to
gnunet-insert with the \-i option. The \-S option is used to indicate
sporadically updated content. You can use the \-N option to specify
the future identifier of the update (only for the first update of
periodically updated content).  Without \-N, gnunet\-insert will
select (and output) a random identifier that must be used for the next
update.  You can use the option \-u to specify the identifier of the
previous version of the content that you want to update.
.PP
You can use automatic meta\-data extraction (based on libextractor) or
the command\-line option \-m to specify meta-data.  For the \-m option
you need to use the form keyword\-type:value.  For example, use "\-m
os:Linux" to specify that the operating system is Linux.  Common
meta\-data types are "author", "title" , "mimetype", "filename",
"language", "subject" and "keywords".  A full list can be obtained
from the extract tool using the option \-\-list.  The meta-data is
used to help users in searching for files on the network.  The
keywords are case\-sensitive.
.PP
GNUnet supports two styles of publishing files on the network.
Inserting a file means that a copy of the file is made in the local
(!) database of the node.  Indexing a file means that an index is
added to the local (!)  database with symbolic links to the file
itself.  The links will use the SHA-512 hash of the entire file as the
filename.  Indexing is generally significantly more efficient and the
default choice.  However, indexing only works if the indexed file can
be read (using the same absolute path) by gnunetd.  If this is not the
case, indexing will fail (and gnunet-insert will automatically revert
to inserting instead).  Regardless of which method is used to publish
the file, the file will be slowly (depending on how often it is
requested and on how much bandwidth is available) dispersed into the
network.  If you insert or index a file and then leave the network, it
will almost always NOT be available anymore.

\fB\-c \fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-config=FILENAME\fR
Use alternate config file (if this option is not specified, the
default is ~/.gnunet/gnunet.conf).

\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-copy\fR 
Even if using links to the .gnunet directory is generally permitted,
make a copy of the file (disables symlinking even if it is possible).
When indexing a file, gnunet\-insert will create a copy of the file in
the "share" directory of gnunetd.  If that directory happens to be on
the local machine (i.e. gnunetd runs on localhost) then gnunet\-insert
can instead just use a link.  This will not work over the network, if
the file\-permissions do not allow gnunetd to read the file or if the
file maybe changed afterwards.  Hence the default is to be inefficient
and to make a copy.  With this option you can force gnunet\-insert to
not make a link.  gnunet\-insert will fall back to creating a copy.

.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-disable\-direct\fR 
Disable direct indexing information that would otherwise refer to
files inside of directories directly.  Without \-D, contents can be
found directly using keywords extracted with libextractor.  Use \-D if
you index directories with many similar files that are adequately
described using keywords for the directory and for which individual
references would unduely pollute the global keyword search space.  Also
use \-D to disable libextractor for individual file publications.
This way you can ensure that a file will only be referenced using the
keywords that you are specifying explicitly.

.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-extract\fR
Print the list of keywords that will be extracted.  Do not perform any
indexing or insertion.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a brief help page with all the options.

.TP
\fB\-H \fIHOSTNAME\fR, \fB\-\-host=\fIHOSTNAME\fR
on which host is gnunetd running (default: localhost).  You can also
specify a port using the syntax HOSTNAME:PORT.  The default port is
2087.

.TP
\fB\-i \fISECONDS\fR, \fB\-\-interval=\fISECONDS\fR
Specifies the update frequency of the content in seconds. This option
is only valid together with the \-P option. If no current and next ID
are specified, the system picks some random start values for the
sequence.

.PP
Most recent update can be found by gnunet\-gtk
automatically. gnunet\-search will print all edition ids between the
insertion time and the current time. A new search can be then
performed with one of the printed keys.  Also, using gnunet\-insert
for updating content is cumbersome, in the future gnunet\-gtk will
provide a more interactive way to manage content updates.

.TP
\fB\-k \fIKEYWORD\fR, \fB\-\-key=KEYWORD\fR
additional key to index the content with (to add multiple keys,
specify multiple times). Each additional key is case-sensitive. Can be
specified multiple times.  The keyword is only applied to the
top\-level files or directories.

.TP
\fB\-K \fIKEYWORD\fR, \fB\-\-global-key=KEYWORD\fR
additional key to index the content with.  Keywords specified with \-K
are applied to files and directories encountered on the command\-line
or in the recursive scan.  This is the only difference to the \-k
option.  This option can be specified multiple times.

.TP
\fB\-L \fILOGLEVEL\fR, \fB\-\-loglevel=\fILOGLEVEL\fR
Change the loglevel.  Possible values for LOGLEVEL are NOTHING, FATAL,
ERROR, WARNING, INFO, STATUS and DEBUG.  Note that options in the 
configuration file take precedence over this option (the argument 
will be ignored in that case).

.TP
\fB\-m \fITYPE:VALUE\fR, \fB\-\-meta=\fITYPE:VALUE\fR
For the main file (or directory), set the metadata of the given TYPE
to the given VALUE.  Note that this will not add the respective VALUE
to the set of keywords under which the file can be found.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-noindex\fR
Executive summary: You probably don't need it.

Do not index, full insertion.  Note that directories, RBlocks, SBlocks
and IBlocks are always inserted (even without this option).  With this
option, every block of the actual files is stored in encrypted form in
the block database of the local peer.  While this adds security if the
local node is compromised (the adversary snags your machine), it is
significantly less efficient compared to on\-demand encryption and is
definitely not recommended for large files.

.TP
\fB\-N \fIID\fR, \fB\-\-next=\fIID\fR
Specifies the next ID of a future version of the SBlock.  This option
is only valid together with the \-P option.  This option can be used
to specify what the identifier of an updated version will look like.
Without the \-i option, a one\-shot update SBlock is used
(a\-periodic).  With the \-i option, the difference between the
current ID (this) and the next ID is used to compute all future IDs.
Note that specifying \-i and \-N without \-t hardly ever makes sense.

The ID can be given in HEX notation, otherwise the HEX code is derived
by hashing the given ID string.

.TP
\fB\-p \fIPRIORITY\fR, \fB\-\-prio=\fIPRIORITY\fR
Executive summary: You probably don't need it.

Set the priority of the inserted content (default: 65535).  If the
local database is full, GNUnet will discard the content with the
lowest ranking.  Note that ranks change over time depending on
popularity.  The default should be high enough to preserve the locally
inserted content in favor of content that migrates from other peers.

.TP
\fB\-P \fINAME\fR, \fB\-\-pseudonym=\fINAME\fR
For the top\-level directory or file, create an SBlock that places the
file into the namespace specified by the pseudonym NAME.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-simulate-only\fR
When this option is used, gnunet\-insert will not actually publish
the file but just simulate what would be done.  This can be used to
compute the GNUnet URI for a file without actually sharing it.

.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-sporadic\fR
This option specifies that the file will be updated sporadically but
not periodically.  It is only valid in conjunction with the \-P
option.  It is implied if \-N is specified but not \-i.  It cannot be
used together with the \-i option.  Use \-S if you intend to publish
an update at an unknown point in the future and if you want
gnunet\-insert to pick a random identifier for that future content.

If you use \-P but not \-S, \-N or \-i, the content will not be updateable.

.TP
\fB\-t \fIID\fR, \fB\-\-this=\fIID\fR
Specifies the ID of the SBlock.  This option is only valid together
with the\ -s option and together with either the option \-b or only a
single filename on the command-line.

The ID can be given in HEX notation, otherwise the HEX code is derived
by hashing the given ID string which may be a natural language
keyword.

.TP
\fB\-T \fITIME\fR, \fB\-\-time=\fITIME\fR
Specifies the SBlock creation time.  The required format depends on
your locale.

This option can be used to publish past and future periodical
SBlocks. The option works best when used together with \-e. Default
time is the current time.

.TP
\fB\-u \fIURI\fR, \fB\-\-uri=\fIURI\fR
This option can be used to specify the URI of a file instead of
a filename (this is the only case where the otherwise mandatory
filename argument must be omitted).  Instead of publishing a file
or directory and using the corresponding URI, gnunet\-insert will
use this URI and perform the selected namespace or keyword 
operations.  This can be used to add additional keywords to a
file that has already been shared or to add files to a namespace
for which the URI is known but the content is not locally available.

.TP
\fB\-U \fIID\fR, \fB\-\-update=\fIID\fR
When updating an entry in the namespace, this option can be used
to specify the ID of the previous entry.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version number.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose.  Using this option causes gnunet\-insert to print progress
information and at the end the file identification that can be used to
download the file from GNUnet.


.SH EXAMPLES
.PP

\fBBasic examples\fR

Index a file COPYING:

 # gnunet\-insert COPYING

Insert a file COPYING:

 # gnunet\-insert \-n COPYING

Index a file COPYING with the keywords \fBgpl\fR and \fBtest\fR:

 # gnunet\-insert \-k gpl \-k test COPYING

Index a file COPYING with description "GNU License", mime-type "text/plain" and keywords \fBgpl\fR and \fBtest\fR:

 # gnunet\-insert \-m "description:GNU License" \-k gpl \-k test -m "mimetype:text/plain" COPYING

\fBUsing directories\fR

Index the files COPYING and AUTHORS with keyword \fBtest\fR and build
a directory containing the two files.  Make the directory itself
available under keyword \fBgnu\fR and disable keyword extraction using
libextractor:

 # mkdir gnu
 # mv COPYING AUTHORS gnu/
 # gnunet\-insert \-K test \-k gnu \-D gnu/

Neatly publish an image gallery in \fBkittendir/\fR and its subdirs
with keyword \fBkittens\fR for the directory but no keywords for the
individual files or subdirs (\-n).  Force description for all files:

 # gnunet\-insert \-n \-m "description:Kitten collection" \-k kittens kittendir/

\fBSecure publishing with namespaces\fR

Insert file COPYING with pseudonym RIAA (\-P) and with identifier \fBgpl\fR (\-t) and no updates:

 # gnunet\-insert \-P RIAA \-t gpl COPYING

Recursively index /home/ogg and build a matching directory
structure.  Insert the top\-level directory into the namespace under
the pseudonym RIAA (\-P) under identifier MUSIC (\-t) and promise to
provide an update with identifier VIDEOS (\-N) at an arbitrary point
in the future (\-S is implied by lack of \-i and presence of \-N):

 # gnunet\-insert \-P RIAA \-t MUSIC \-N VIDEOS /home/ogg

Recursively insert (\-n) /var/lib/mysql and build a matching
directory structure, but disable the use of libextractor to extract
keywords (\-n).  Print the file identifiers (\-V) that can be used to
retrieve the files.  This will store a copy of the MySQL database in
GNUnet but without adding any keywords to search for it.  Thus only
people that have been told the secret file identifiers printed with
the \-V option can retrieve the (secret?) files:

 # gnunet\-insert \-nV /var/lib/mysql

Create a periodical SBlock with a sporadic update interval and announce
that the next update will be called 'next':

 # gnunet\-insert \-P MPAA \-N next \-S noise.mp3

Update the periodical SBlock using settings from a previous time:

 # gnunet\-insert \-P MPAA \-t next -N nextnext noise_updated.mp3
