		Some options apply to experimental code that maybe in a state 
		of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
		testing is not yet high enough for general use.  These features 
		are said to be of "alpha" quality.   If a feature is currently in 
               	alpha, uninformed use is discouraged (since the developers then
                do not fancy "Why doesn't this work?" type messages).

       	        However, active testing and qualified feedback of these features
               	is always welcome.  Users should just be aware that alpha features
		may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
		in some special cases.  Bug reports are usually welcomed by the 
               	developers, but please read the documents <file://README> and

		Which applications should gnunetd support? Specify the name of the
		dynamic shared object (DSO) that implements the service in the
		gnunetd core here. Separate multiple modules with spaces.
		
		Whenever this option is changed, you MUST run gnunet-update.
		
		Currently, the available applications are:

		advertising: tell peers about peers
			This module will advertise your peer to other peers.
			Without it, your peer will not participate in 
			informing peers about other peers.  You should 
			always load this module.
		getoption: configuration
			This module allows clients to query gnunetd about
			the values of various configuration options.  Many
			tools need this.  You should always load this module.
		stats: statistics 
			This module allows tools like gnunet-stats
			and gnunet-gtk to query gnunetd about various
			statistics.  This information is usually quite
			useful to diagnose errors, hence it is recommended
			that you load this module.
		traffic: traffic analysis 
			This module keeps track of how many messages of
			which type and size were recently received and
			transmitted.  This information can then be used
			by your peer to establish how much cover traffic
			is currently available.  The amount of cover 
			traffic becomes important if you want to make
			anonymous requests with an anonymity level that
			is greater than one.  This module does not add
			support for any new peer-to-peer messages itself.
			It is recommended that you always load this module,
			unless you are really short on memory and are
			certain that you do not require good anonymity.
		fs: file sharing
			The file sharing module is needed for downloading
			files, for caching content within the network and
			for being the source of content.  At this point,
			pretty much everybody should load this module.
		chat: broadcast chat (demo-application, ALPHA quality)
			If this module is loaded, you can run gnunet-chat
			(text-mode only) to chat with other GNUnet users.
			However, there are no channels and no list of users
			on-line, the code simply broadcasts your messages.
		tbench: benchmark tool for transport performance
			If two peers load this module and establish a direct
			connection, the gnunet-tbench tool can be used to
			measure the quality of the connection between the
			two peers.  Useful mostly for testing new transports.
		tracekit: topology visualization toolkit
			Peers that load this module can be queried for their
			active connections (in fact, this is transitive for
			all peers that load this module).  Using the
			gnunet-tracekit tool it is possible to create a
			picture of the network topology.  Note that the
			picture maybe incomplete since peers that do not
			load the tracekit module will not respond to such
			requests and thus cut off the trace.  Also, some
			peers may fail to respond within the specified
			timeout.  Note that while tracing the topology
			maybe fun, loading tracekit may make it easier 
			for an adversary to compromise your anonymity.
		
		Again, the chat, tbench and tracekit protocols are potential security 
		risks and have been engineered for testing GNUnet or demonstrating how
		GNUnet works. They should be used with caution.
		
		In order to download or share files with GNUnet, you must load the
		fs module which in turn requires or recommends getoption, stats
		and traffic.  

		Everybody should run advertising.
		
		Default: APPLICATIONS = "advertising fs getoption stats traffic"

	config TRANSPORTS

	help
		Which transport mechanisms are available? Use space-separated list
		of the modules, e.g.  "udp smtp tcp". The order is irrelevant, each
		protocol has a build-in cost-factor and this factor determines which
		protocols are preferred.  
		
		The available transports at this point are udp, tcp, http, smtp,
		tcp6, udp6 and the special 'nat' service.
		
		Loading the 'nat' and 'tcp' modules is required for peers behind NAT
		boxes that cannot directly be reached from the outside.  Peers that
		are NOT behind a NAT box and that want to *allow* peers that ARE
		behind a NAT box to connect must ALSO load the 'nat' module.  Note
		that the actual transfer will always be via tcp initiated by the peer
		behind the NAT box.
		
		Usually, the default is just fine for most people.

	bool "Basic bandwidth limiting"
	default y
	help
		Use basic bandwidth limitation? (YES/NO).  If in doubt, say YES.

                Basic bandwidth limitation (YES) means simply that the bandwidth limits
                specified apply to GNUnet and only to GNUnet.  If set to YES, you
                simply specify the maximum bandwidth (upstream and downstream) 
                that GNUnet is allowed to use and GNUnet will stick to those
                limitations.  This is useful if your overall bandwidth is so large that
                the limit is mostly used to ensure that enough capacity is left for
                other applications.  Even if you want to dedicate your entire connection
                to GNUnet you should not set the limits to values higher than what you
                have since GNUnet uses those limits to determine for example the number
                of connections to establish (and it would be inefficient if that 
                computation yields a number that is far too high).  

                While basic bandwidth limitation is simple and always works, there are
                some situations where it is not perfect.  Suppose you are running
                another application which performs a larger download.  During that
                particular time, it would be nice if GNUnet would throttle its
                bandwidth consumption (automatically) and resume using more bandwidth
                after the download is complete.  This is obviously advanced magic since
                GNUnet will have to monitor the behavior of other applications. 
                Another scenario is a monthly cap on bandwidth imposed by your ISP,
                which you would want to ensure is obeyed.  Here, you may want
                GNUnet to monitor the traffic from other applications to ensure that
                the combined long-term traffic is within the pre-set bounds.  Note
                that you should probably not set the bounds tightly since GNUnet may
                observe that the bounds are about to be broken but would be unable to
                stop other applications from continuing to use bandwidth.

                If either of these two scenarios applies, set BASICLIMITING to NO.
                Then set the bandwidth limits to the COMBINED amount of traffic that
                is accepable for both GNUnet and other applications.  GNUnet will
                then immediately throttle bandwidth consumption if the short-term
                average is above the limit, and it will also try to ensure that the
                long-term average is below the limit.  Note however that using NO
                can have the effect of GNUnet (almost) ceasing operations after
                other applications perform high-volume downloads that are beyond the
                defined limits.  GNUnet would reduce consumption until the long-term
                limits are again within bounds.

                NO only works on platforms where GNUnet can monitor the amount of
                traffic that the local host puts out on the network.  This is only
                implemented for Linux and Win32.  In order for the code to work, GNUnet
                needs to know the specific network interface that is used for the
                external connection (after all, the amount of traffic on loopback
                or on the LAN should never be counted since it is irrelevant).

			With this option, you can specify which networks you do NOT want to
			connect to. Usually you will want to filter loopback (127.0.0.1,
			misconfigured GNUnet hosts), virtual private networks, [add a class
			C network here], 192.168.0.0, 172.16.0.0 and 10.0.0.0 (RFC
			1918). The format is IP/NETMASK where the IP is specified in
			dotted-decimal and the netmask either in CIDR notation (/16) or in
			dotted decimal (255.255.0.0). Several entries must be separated by a
			semicolon, spaces are not allowed.  Notice that if your host is on a
			private network like the above, you will have to configure your NAT
			to allow incoming requests and you will want to modify this option.
			The idea behind this option is not to discriminate against NAT users
			but to ensure that hosts only attempt to connect to machines that
			they have a chance to actually reach.  Of course, you could also use
			it against known adversaries that have a small IP range at their
			disposal :-)
			Example (and default):
			BLACKLIST = 127.0.0.1/8;192.168.0.0/16;10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0;

			content from the network if the current space-consumption is below
			the number given here (and if content migration is allowed below).

			refuse to work.  Default is 1024 (1 GB)

		config ACTIVEMIGRATION

		default y
		depends on Meta::ADVANCED
		help
			Should we participate in content migration?  If you say yes here,
			GNUnet will migrate content to your server, and you will not be able
			to control what data is stored on your machine.  This option has
			advantages and disadvantages.
			
			If you activate it, you can claim for *all* the non-indexed (-n to
			gnunet-insert) content that you did not know what it was even if an
			adversary takes control of your machine.
			
			If you do not activate it, it is obvious that you have knowledge of
			all the content that is hosted on your machine and thus can be
			considered liable for it.  
			
			So if you think that the legal system in your country has gone
			postal, you may want to set it to "NO" and make sure that the
			content you put on your machine does not get you into too much
			trouble if an adversary takes control of your machine.  If you think
			that you're safe if you host content that you don't know anything
			about (like an ISP) or that you don't have to fear prosecution
			no-matter-what, turn it to YES, which will also improve GNUnet's
			performance and thereby your results.
			
			Note that as long as the adversary is not really powerful (e.g. can
			not take control of your machine), GNUnet's build-in anonymity
			mechanisms should protect you from being singled out easily.
			
			Currently, activating active migration can cause some problems when
			the database is getting full (gdbm reorganization can take very,
			very long and make GNUnet look like it hangs for that time). Thus if
			you turn it on, you may want to disable it after you hit the
			quota. A better content management system should solve this problem
			in the near future... [at the time of GNUnet 0.6.1c, the MySQL 
			database module already works well even if the db is full.]
			Default is YES.
