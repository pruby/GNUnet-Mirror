This file lists the known problems with GNUnet on various platforms.

Let us know if you know more about it then we do.  The test is quite
easy.  Run "make check" and "gnunet-transport-check" *after*
configuring GNUnet (including placing a valid configuration files at
~/.gnunet/gnunet.conf and /etc/gnunetd.conf).  That should yield all
the information necessary (assuming it compiles).
